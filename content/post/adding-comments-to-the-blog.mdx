Comments are important to a blog, people love to engage but I did not want to pay for a service, or invade my readers with ads or tracking everything they do. I want to improve the quality of the blog and comments felt like the right direction, allowing people to commment and let me know how they felt about each post.

## What did I pick?

I chose Utteranc which is a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. It uses GitHub to allow people to comment on a blog post, they just sign in with the GitHub and can comment away.

### Why did I pick Utteranc?

1. It's 100% open source
2. No ads, no tracking
3. Git backed (Means I keep the comment data)
4. Extremely lightweight

### How Did I implement this on NextJS?

I decided to go with a hook that is referenced in a component. I could of just implemented an async script but where is the fun in that?

Below is the hook code:

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export const useUtterances = commentNodeId => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const scriptParentNode = document.getElementById(commentNodeId);
    if (!scriptParentNode) return;
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'https://utteranc.es/client.js';
    script.async = true;
    script.setAttribute('repo', 'REPO_NAME');
    script.setAttribute('issue-term', 'pathname');
    script.setAttribute('label', 'comment :speech_balloon:');
    script.setAttribute('theme', 'github-light');
    script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous');

    scriptParentNode.appendChild(script);

    return () => {
      // cleanup - remove the older script with previous theme
      scriptParentNode.removeChild(scriptParentNode.firstChild);
    };
  }, [commentNodeId]);
};
```

This creates a script that is async and fills in all the important pieces needed to make it work with utterance. This is also extendable so technically I could implement useState and change the theme based upon dark or light mode.

The component then takes the hook and then returns an div ready for comments:

```javascript
import { useUtterances } from '../lib/useUtterances';

const commentNodeId = 'comments';

const Comments = () => {
  useUtterances(commentNodeId);
  return <div id={commentNodeId} />;
};

export default Comments;
```

Now I can reference it anywhere in my application and it will show up using `<Comments/>`
