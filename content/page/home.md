        description: >-
          The podcast isn't like most podcasts. I interview people in tech from
          developers to CEOs. Except instead of talking about work, we talk
          about what we do outside out of work!

          Here we are, the new year is upon us, and if you are like me, you have
          set
            some New Year’s resolutions for yourself. Possibly learning a new language,
            skill or improving on the foundation that you have. What a better way to kick
            off the year then we with a crash course!

        title: Dealing with Date objects in Next data fetching
        author: James Perkins
        category: tutorials
        description: >-
          When working with Data objects in ServerSideProps or StaticProps
          Next.js doesn't like it because they don't serailize it for
          performance. So you are on your own to handle it.

        description: >-
          I have to focus on important tasks throughout the day and I find I can
          get
            distracted easily, as a YouTube and Dev Advocate there are plenty of excuses
            to open Twitter, TikTok or YouTube. I use Session and AppleScript to automate
            this
